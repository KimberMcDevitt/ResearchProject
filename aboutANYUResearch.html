      <p>Any University is <strong>committed</strong> to over-arching, use-inspired, solution-focused research that helps tackle global challenges while fostering an <strong>investigative</strong> environment that is <strong>collaborative</strong> and <strong>interdiciplinary</strong>.
        Any University research helps create new thinking on health, security and sustainability and results in new capabilities and discoveries that help bring understanding to our world. </p><p>The pages in this project represent a study of proposal data.  This is just the beginning of the analytical possiblities that exist when working with research data.
        Much of what is included in this study are proof of concept vizualizations that can evolve when award data is included.  Look for this new perspective to be included in Fall 2017.</p>
